# RC-Bose-Summer-Intern-2019
``
This repository contains the works done by me,Swastik Banerjee, and Suvraneel Chatterjee as project under Nilanjan Datta and Ashwin Jha in R.C. Bose Centre for Cryptology and Security,ISI Kol Summer Internship 2019.
``
          <br/><br/>We tried on automizing the security check of a cipher against Linear and Differential Cryptanalysis.
<br/>Aim:<br/>
    Our main task was, given any cipher, we can check min. no of Active S-boxes for each round using GLPK solver and find out hence how many minimum rounds are required for it to be resistant to linear/differential cryptanalysis.
